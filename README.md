# rsrtools

**rsrtools** is a package for creating and saving Rocksmith 2014 songlists **to** 
Rocksmith save files (profiles). Incidentally, it also provides tools for managing
Rocksmith profiles.

This is a temporary README for rsrtools while github works through issues on 
rendering `.rst` files (https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/86715).

Until the `.rst` render/preview issue is sorted, the best place to view documentation is
at the pypi landing page: https://pypi.org/project/rsrtools/.
